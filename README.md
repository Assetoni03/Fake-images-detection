# Fake-images-detection
This project is written for a capstone project and finds images generated by a neural network.Recognizes pictures drawn by hand and with the help of special programs such as Paint.When creating a neural network, the CNN algorithm and the CIFAKE dataset were used. The neural network has an architecture similar to VGG 16, accuracy is over 90%
