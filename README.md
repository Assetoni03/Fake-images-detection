# Fake-images-detection
This project is written for a capstone project. The essence is to find images generated by a neural network. Additionally, it can distinguish between hand-drawn pictures and pictures drawn using special programs such as Paint. When creating this neural network, the CNN algorithm and a dataset called CIFAKE were used. The neural network has an architecture similar to VGG 16, the accuracy of the model was above 90%
